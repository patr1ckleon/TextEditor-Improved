# Summary
With the help of a youtube tutorial, I created a ASP.Net Core Application from the ground up. I created a 5 page document outlining the steps taken to create it and learned the following:
- User Authentication and Account Maganagement
- User owned based Docs
- Document CRUD
- Textarea created using TinyMCE
- Security and Validation
- Data and Persistence (SQL Server with Entity Framework Core)
- Project Structure (Controllers and Views)

In the images below we can see the baseline website vs the initial changes/additions I made for a more visually appealling UI and introduction of animations:

**(any new changes can be seen here: https://texteditorimproved.azurewebsites.net/)**

## Current Improvements Checklist
- Add background animation ✅
- Improve Layout (ongoing)✅
- Add mouse cursor-responsive animations ✅
- AI Sidebar Assistant (Early ideas is using SignalR or SSE for streaming responses to the editor)
- Slash Commands (In the text editor typing "/" will allow user to insert blocks like headings, tables, code, formulas, etc.)
- Command Palette (for quick actions like renaming doc, export PDF, toggle dark or light mode, run AI side bar assistant, etc.)
- Add Collaboration Functionality
